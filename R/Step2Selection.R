#'@title Select a Subset of the Measures Using Factor Analysis
#'
#'@description This function applies the following dimension reduction algorithm
#'  to the measures computed by \code{\link[traj]{Step1Measures}}:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Drop the measures whose values are constant across the trajectories;
#'   \item Whenever two measures are highly correlated (absolute value of Pearson correlation > 0.98), keep the highest-ranking measure on the list (see \code{\link[traj]{Step1Measures}}) and drop the other;
#'   \item Use principal component analysis (PCA) on the measures to form factors summarizing the variability in the measures;
#'   \item Drop the factors whose variance is smaller than any one of the standardized measures;
#'   \item Perform a varimax rotation on the remaining factors;
#'   \item For each rotated factor, select the measure that has the highest correlation (aka factor loading) with it and that hasn't yet been selected;
#'   \item Drop the remaining measures.
#' }
#'
#'@param trajMeasures object of class \code{trajMeasures} as returned by
#'  \code{\link[traj]{Step1Measures}}.
#'@param num.select an optional positive integer indicating the number of
#'  factors to keep in the second stage of the algorithm. Defaults to \code{NULL} so
#'  that all factors with variance greater than any one of the normalized
#'  measures are selected.
#'@param discard an optional vector of positive integers corresponding to the
#'  measures to be dropped from the analysis. See
#'  \code{\link[traj]{Step1Measures}} for the list of measures. Defaults to
#'  \code{NULL}.
#'@param select an optional vector of positive integers corresponding to the
#'  measures to forcefully select. Defaults to \code{NULL}. If a vector is supplied,
#'  the five-steps selection algorithm described above is bypassed and the
#'  corresponding measures are selected instead.
#'@param x object of class \code{trajSelection}.
#'@param object object of class  \code{trajSelection}.
#'@param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#'
#'@return An object of class \code{trajSelection}; a list containing the values
#'  of the selected measures, the output of the principal component analysis as
#'  well as a curated form of the arguments.
#'
#'@details Whenever two measures are highly correlated (Pearson correlation >
#'0.98), the highest-ranking measure on the list (see \code{\link[traj]{Step1Measures}}) is kept and the other is discarded and discards the others. PCA is applied on the remaining measures using the \code{\link[psych]{principal}} function from the \code{psych} package.
