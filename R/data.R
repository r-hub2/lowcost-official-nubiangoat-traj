#' @description An artificially created data set with 130 trajectories split into four groups, labelled A, B, C, D according to the data generating process.
#'
#' @format This data frame has 130 rows and the following 7 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{ID}{An identification variable that runs from 1 to 130.}
#'   \item{Group}{A character variable that's either "A", "B", "C" or "D" depending on which of the four data generating process the trajectory is coming from.}
#'   \item{X1}{The observation of the trajectory at time t = 1.}
#'   \item{X2}{The observation of the trajectory at time t = 2.}
#'   \item{X3}{The observation of the trajectory at time t = 3.}
#'   \item{X4}{The observation of the trajectory at time t = 4.}
#'   \item{X5}{The observation of the trajectory at time t = 5.}
#'   \item{X6}{The observation of the trajectory at time t = 6.}
