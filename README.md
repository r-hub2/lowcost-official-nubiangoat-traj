# traj

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of traj is to implement a three-step procedure in the spirit of
Leffondree et al. (2004) to identify clusters of individual longitudinal
trajectories. The procedure involves (1) computing a number of “measures
of change”” capturing various features of the trajectories; (2) using a
Principal Component Analysis based dimension reduction algorithm to
select a subset of measures and (3) using the k-means clustering
algorithm to identify clusters of trajectories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of traj from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IcatianTrout/traj")
```

## Example

See the vignette.
